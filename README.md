# SOCKS5 Proxy Email Sender Sample

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to send an email using a SOCKS5 proxy (compatible with port 25 for email traffic). It's useful for developers building email verification or sending tools that require proxying to improve deliverability or bypass restrictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PySocks: `pip install PySocks`

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install PySocks`
2. Replace placeholders with your SMTP details and proxy info.
3. Run the script: `python script.py`

This script sets up a SOCKS5 proxy and sends a test email through it.
